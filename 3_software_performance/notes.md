# How to understand the performance of your software

_Bob Sinkovits_

- processor: `/proc/cpuinfo`
- memory: `/proc/meminfo`

A few other commands that I found useful are:
  - lshw
  - lsblk
  - lspci
  - lsusb

If using gnome, or other Desktop Environments in X-Windows, the "Disks" application is very useful.
